Pull Requests
-------------

Pyomo manages source code contributions via pull requests. For a pull request
to be accepted, it must satisfy all code integration and coverage tests, and
then pass review by two core developers. For core developers, authorship of a
pull request counts as a review.

Submitted code that addresses an issue should include a test exercising the
relevant case. New functionality should include tests to establish validity of
its results and/or effects.
